# Rest_API
Partial code solution for week 8 lab. Contains working REST API

The repository contains a working Web REST API written using ASP.NET CORE and C#. The solution offers a couple of entpoints for a simple todo items application.  

You should try to implement additional endpoints for other data models. I suggest adding a _User_ model with attributes such as:

* UserID
* UserName
* UserEmail
* UserFirstName
* UserSurname

Your second endpoint should support CRUD requests over REST.
